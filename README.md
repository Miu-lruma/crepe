Crepe is a tool that allows a user to generate a file structure for a new program in a variety of languages, including C, Java, Python, and HTML.

The tool works based on the file extension of the created file.  For example, `crepe myProgram.py` will create a file with a header and basic initial python code.

There are many options that a user can choose to modify the resulting file.  All of these can be seen by running `crepe -h`.  An example of a modification would be `crepe -c myProgram.py`, which will produce the same file as the above example, but with no aditional code.
